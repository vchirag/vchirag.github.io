title: Self-assembling BiFeO\(_3\) Nanoparticles
description: This exploration used an ancient-contemporary experimental technique, i.e., Langmuir-Blodgett (-Pockels) deposition, to self-assemble bismuth ferrite nanoparticles on a silica substrate.

##### Summary
Much of the project has been adequately described in the report. However, I would like to point out that, in this case, the magnetic nature of the nanoparticles (or I presume) is the primary reason for them to form patterns and assemblies.

##### Comments


As a result of the sudden saturation in my efforts to study extensive mathematics, this project felt like a light breeze. And it (might have) laid the foundation for my future aspirations to study self-assembly, specifically in the biological domain.

A possible continuation of this work is to simulate the near particle-particle interactions using _molecular dynamics_.
