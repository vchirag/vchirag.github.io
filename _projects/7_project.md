##### Summary
In this digression, we studied a peculiar physical system- A weakly relativistic degenerate dusty plasma. The term dusty signifies the presence of micro-nanometer particles suspended within the plasma's volume. And for our consideration, such particles are assumed to be negatively charged.

We assumed the existence of the following equations- the continuity equation in a fluid and the Poisson equation. The relativistic electron degeneracy pressure was supposed to be given for granted, and to date (as of the year 2022), I am still trying to figure out how to derive it.

Further, we normalized the equations and perturbatively expanded the required variables to get the desired results.

##### Comments

For the fun of it, this short walk into the realm of plasma physics was enjoyable. However, the concepts were purely mathematical, and I lost the physical insight. Moreover, the year 2020 brought new challenges with itself, mainly because of Covid. And for us students, it was the insufficiency of finding internships. I consider myself fortunate enough to get my hands dirty with some literature surveys related to this work.
