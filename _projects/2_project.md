            <li><b>COMMENT</b>: Initially, the project did not have any simulation content. But having some simulations up one's sleeve highly enhances the quality of the work.</li>
            <li>Since I had a lot of trouble while installing LAMMPS, I thought it would be nice to delineate the process here for future reference.<br>
            <b>Operating System</b>: Linux Mint 20.3 x86_64<br>
            After several failed attempts to install <a href = "https://www.open-mpi.org/" title = "open-mpi webpage">MPI</a> on my machine, I gave up further attempts to install LAMMPS from the source. As I did not require any out-of-the-box computing capabilities, I installed a precompiled LAMMPS binary. Section 2.1.1. <a href = "https://docs.lammps.org/Install_linux.html#ubuntu" title = "LAMMPS binary documentation">here</a> explains the procedure.<br> 
            <b>NOTE</b>: I will update this excerpt later on how to install LAMMPS from the source.
