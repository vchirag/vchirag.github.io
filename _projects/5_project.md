title: Neutrino Interactions
description: This work investigated various techniques for separating <i> good </i> particle data from raw data generated in particle detectors. The primary aim was to find evidence of charged current reactions, majorly CC\(\pi^+\) and CC\(\pi^0\) interactions, in raw data of Japan's T2K neutrino detector.

##### Summary
Since my code wasn't producing the desired results, the code of the final task is mainly due to my colleague- Caetano Ternes, UFSC, Brazil. 

What did we do? We primarily searched for the desired signals by restricting ourselves to a minimal fiducial volume.
This was followed by extensive searches for reaction candidates that resulted in the creation of positively charged pion and either one or zero protons.

Various pull variables were used to segregate the data and perform necessary cuts. The reactions were also categorized according to their topologies. Lastly, purity and efficiency were calculated.

##### Comments
This project was my first international collaboration, and I enjoyed being a part of a tri-national collaborating trio. And during the course of the project, I realized that we (humans) only exist because of a common language to express ourselves. 

I hope(d) to study CKM matrix formulation sometime.
