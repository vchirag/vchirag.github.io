The skills I developed during the project's duration:
<ul>
    <li> Writing clean code (possibly) and making an environment in python </li>
    <li> Physics of stellar flares </li>
    <li> Statistical techniques to increase the SNR ratio in the given dataset</li>
    <li> *An aspiration to study dynamical systems and self-ordered criticality.   
</ul>
